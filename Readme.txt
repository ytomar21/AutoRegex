# Step 1

To generate AutoRegex Files: in this directory run:
    python main.py --rubric_dir <dirofRubricFile> --topScorer_dir <dirOfTopScorerFile>
        --output_file <nameOfOutputFileYouWant>

# Step 2

After generated AutoRegex File is made: cd LT-Autograder

# Step 3

Tandalla's code already has a well documented read me, please look at: Instructions_Linux.txt
    or Instructions_Windows.txt in this directory and follow the steps

    *Note: Tandalla's code needs to be run in python 2 not python 3, I made a separate conda environment
       for this

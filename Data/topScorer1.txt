some additional information you will need are the material . you also need to know the size of the container to measure how the acid rain effected it . you need to know how much vinegar is used for each sample . another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measuring the best possible way .
the additional information you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples . also you would need to know the kind of vinegar . in a addition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers .
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the shape of each material because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass changes the results . i would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment .
in order for the me to replicate their procedure i would need to know what four samples they used they should include that in their procedure . also they should stay where you are to put the four containers during the hour time period finally they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment i would in as close to what they actually did and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment .
for this experiments duplication you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup . you would also have to know how big in size each container was . additionally you would need to know the size of each sample to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly .
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were . in this group s procedure they do not state what
for this experiment you would actually need to know what each sample is the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each sample
to replicate the experiment i would need to know the samples that i will be using . i would also need to know how much vinegar to use . i would also need to know what type of containers to use .
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container . you also need to know what to be of containers to pour the vinegar in . also you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water .
after reading the procedure i would first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distilled water .
determine what the different samples are then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample . state how long you are rising the materials in water . ex minutes
how much vinegar should you pour with what label and when to sit it it stand dry for min . . . label . the container s repeatedly separate but identical containers . what containers should we use
some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in . also in step it says add a sample of each material . we need to know how big the sample would have to be . something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in is it room temperature we need to know this .
to replicate the experiment the procedure would require more detail . one piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment . it is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the hours . finally the procedure needs to include details about the experiment for example if the whole sample must be submerged .
this group left same very important thing out of their procedure . first of all they didn t tell us what samples to use for the experiment . they didn t tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab .
. a list of materials and safety requirements . p . the amount of vinegar to put in the containers . p . the temperature of the room vinegar p . a control group .
in order to replicate ta experiment a person would need to know a few more things . they would need to know which substances to use how much of each one . the person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container . they would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in . one might also want to know what type of container how to write down the findings .
you would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container . what type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment .
the additional things that i would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in . i would also include the samples of what i am testing in the experiment . lastly i would also put in my procedure how much amount of vinegar they are putting in .
to replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure . first we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers enough to cover them next we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material . will we completely submerge it or only partially finally we need to know which materials to use . the data indicates them but the procedure does not .
i think that knowing the temperature in the enjoyment would be very useful i m sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples we wouldn t get the same results . also we need to know what type of environment we should place this in . should it be sunny dark windy hot cold etc . i also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be we don t even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples . this experiment is missing too much information .
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . you would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water . you would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in .
the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container . the amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid . the results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vinegar was increased or decreased . therefore the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
in order to replicate the experiment the procedure would have to add more details . in the first bullet the four samples should be stated as marble limestone wood and plastic . you should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need . there should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment . also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added . one last thing is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say in grams .
the students need to say what the samples are . they need to
additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples . in step i would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container . also in step i would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long .
in addition to the information given you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container different amounts could change the results . there should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at because change in temperature can affect the corrosion process . in the experiment it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size .
first you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about . next you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put in each container . you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample .
we would word correct safety measures to take the control the effect of vinegar what temperature to store them at what the identical containers are made of and its size what type of scale to use to mean it the amount of vinegar in each container i more trials
in order to replicate this experiment there are a few more things i need to know . the problem does not state what the four different samples are . second i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup . the amount of vinegar could impact the mass . last i would need to where to store the samples for the hour period . different temperatures might affect the different samples .
in order to replicate the lab the students did you would need to know what materials were need . what kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples .
after reading the group s procedure additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in for they need to be identical . u also need to know that amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain the same starting mass the group of students received from the samples . another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the old example of the experiment . another good price of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight .
some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit . such as in the sun or in the refrigerator . how much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using
in order to complete this experiment you would need additional information . you would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment . you would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors . you might also need to know to know the constants . what type of vinegar and what time you started .
to replicate this experiment you would also need to know vinegar they used the size of the cup and the the size of the samples .
i would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not it would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into .
to replicate this experiment you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup the temperature of the surroundings and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale .
to repeat this experiment i would need to know the four different samples without knowing that i don t know what i m testing . i also need to know how much vinegar in each of the cups . i would need to know where to put all of the different containers . i don t know if they need to stay at room temp cold or not .
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used because i could have chosen metal cardboard and many other sample materials that they didn t use and would get different results . also i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can cause a major change . lastly they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for minutes because if they are sitting in room temp . or by a light source makes a difference too .
first you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers . you would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of . lastly they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun in a dry cold place etc .
in order to replicate the experiment you need to know what the samples are taken of what size the samples should be what size the containers should be and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample .
after reading that group s procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were . another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample . the last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be .
the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample in order to find the mass of only the sample you need to subtract the mass of the container . also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample . i also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when i am waiting hours . lastly i need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react .
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used . you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water . the size of the container would be essential as well so you would know how much vinegar should be used .
first it doesn t tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers . next it doesn t say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes maybe they need a cover for it but we don t know from this information . in addition there is an information about how they determined the mass .
. what kind of sample of material are you using . . how much vinegar should we put in the containers . . they should be more clear about how to rinse each sample .
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container . also i would need to know of each sample was are solid piece or n small or pieces . the great would need to identify
the procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment . there should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup . the group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a per a sink pieces could chip off decreasing the mass . the group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size .
you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers what order to put samples in take them out allay once and how long to rinse for .
in order to replicate this experiment i need to know the materials what kind of sample material and why are they doing the experiment . how much vinegar rinse or how long
the group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made limestone wood plastic instead of just saying different samples . they also say determine the mass of that substances but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass scale . they need to say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used . lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with and how .
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step . in step a person would need to know the temperature the samples are waiting hours in . in step the procedure states a sample of one material unless the materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure the actual names of each of the materials should be given . temperature for step would also be good additional info as well .
in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things . one thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment . i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers . lastly i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples .
they need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after hours .
. firstly the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are how big they are what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment p . the group does not explain how much vinegar should be poorer into the container how much is needed p . the group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container . even though this is just vinegar their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab . goggle inclusion would also be rise .
additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container . how long do you rinse the samples do the samples stay outside or inside day or night
there is some additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment first i would need to know what the four different samples are . second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the containers . third i would need to know what type of container i should use . last i would need to know where to keep the containers during the hours . these are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment .
the students need to include what the samples were . you can t do an experiment if you don t know what you re testing on . the students should also include the temp . that the containers were stored at for hours . lastly they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container . they could ve put the same amount or different amount . they could ve put little or a lot .
to tell the amount vinegar you pour into the container the size of the container ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water . how many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass .
first they should list the samples they used . marble limestone wood and plastic in their procedure . they should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect . they should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet as a refrigerator or something . not just leaving it out of their processes .
i would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container . how long to rinse it in water materials . and what kind of container ca social use .
in order to replicate this experiment you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the hours what type of climate .
three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment . first is how much vinegar should be allowed to each individual cup as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples . the next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not . third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the hour wait period . should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment .
the group should be more specific including the names of the samples add rain sample etc . . they should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step . in step they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container .
to replicate this experiment the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use . the procedure is very vague . a scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment . therefore the students should specify the marble limestone wood plastic . they should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used .
how much vinegar you pour into the cups . what kind of vinegar you use . what kind of containers you should use .
you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so that you wouldn t use a stronger or weaker ph level . you would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant .
in the procedure it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample . finally additional information that should be added would be telling where to keep these samples where it s cold room or hot temperature .
how much vinegar would you pour in each cup . what temperature would the samples be in would it be the same or would it be different how would also need to know if they used the same size cup . these things are all very important information that wasn t included .
the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers do they want us to use you would need a sample of each of the substances . as well as knowing what type of each substance you need . last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers which changes the mass of each sample .
some additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar size of the containers and the temperature .
i would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as ml . where do i put the cups in the sun or ref rid after where do i let the samples dry in the open or the outside .
after reading the group procedure the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure how much vinegar should i pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface we would have more contact with the vinegar ending it right and the mass of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need know how much of each sample was used .
in order to replicate this procedures you would need to know
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were . also step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific . they might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate .

in order to replicate this group s procedure i would need the following information p . when they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples they should name and list the samples that they plan on using . p . in step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in . p . when they say in step four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water how much water should we use and how long should we rinse .
in order to replicate the group students experiment the additional information i would need to endure how big the four identical containers were how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment . how much vinegar and the students pour into each container .
some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each separate containers . if i did not have the data table i would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are . it would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used . in order to replicate on experiment the procedure must be precise and not have any information out or else the data may come out completely different and not be comparable to the first set of data .
in order to repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for hours so that the experiment does not get ruined due to the surroundings it was in .
you would need a control to look back on you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container in with and get the time right . with the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials .
additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers . also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . also although indicated in the data table the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in . should it be poured limestone a block of wood etc . and also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end . all of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment .
this information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment p amount of vinegar poured p identify types of samples used in the procedure p temperature and p size of containers open closed lid
to replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment . also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers . finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is touching it .
in order to replicate this experiment i would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so i don t put in too much or too little . i would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the samples and lastly if i had only looked at the group s procedure i would need to know what four samples the students used so that i could replicate the experiment . and then i would need to know where the containers were kept so i could give mine the same amount of light and other things .
in order to replicate this experiment the groups would have to list the different mass samples if not then a person might use any different mass samples . also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample . lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers to make this procedure replicate able the group would have to make these change .

you would need to know what the four different samples are . also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . lastly you need to know what temperature to store them at .
the group s procedure was pretty vague there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar and how large the samples are . also each sample should be named in the procedure like determine the mass of marble limestone wood and plastic samples should be stated in the procedure .
just based off of the procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount . you d also need to know what in use as a container as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result . you d also need to know the starting mass of each sample and what the samples are .
you would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material for example plastic could

in order to replicate the experiment i would need other than the procedure what samples to use what materials how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in . these pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results . using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain . finally the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during hours .
some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these things would make very experiment as close as possible to the group s .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal . i would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the hours ex shade sun . lastly i would need to know what kind of container should be used a plastic a covered or a dark container etc .
additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in how big the container should be and if the material should be or shouldn t be fully submerged by the vinegar .
in order to replicate this experiment the group would need some additional information in their procedure . an example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance . they need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container or how big the sample is or what the sample is . it s very vague so they should add more specific .
to replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all cups . this would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome . also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples . say what sample to use in the experiment too .
to tell me what the samples are in the procedure . p how much vinegar to pour in the four containers . p where and at what temperature are they putting them in .
a person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under . all of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know .
in order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample . also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a ref regal tar or leave them at room temperature .
you would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container so the results are accurate . you would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at .
if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure p . how big should the rock samples be p should they be relatively the same size p . how much vinegar should be poured into the containers p . how long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water p . should the containers be made out of any specific material

from this experiment i would need to know how big each of the containers are i would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container if i was to replicate this experiment . i would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers .
to replicate this i would need much more information as to sizes of samples . also there should be more specific size measurements of the containers . lastly they never say how much vinegar to use . p all of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment .
the procedure is unclear . in order to effectively replicate this experiment . i would need to know what the four samples that are needed were i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . it would help to know how large each container was as well . p . vinegar amount . . types of sampling . . containers size .
some additional information i would need is i would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers . i would also need to know what the samples are . to replicate the experiment i would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else .
to replicate this i need to know what samples i m working with . it doesn t tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups . if says after hours remove samples from the containers where do they go for hours
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container . the four different samples mass of them and where they were put is stated . but not how much vinegar was put into the containers .
i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use . also they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion .
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know many details . first i would need to know what samples i am using in order to find their mass . i also would need to know how large each material is . this way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how large the material was . also i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material receives the same amount . last i would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all receive the same amount of water .
in order to replicate the experiment the group s procedure would need to include what each of the different samples were determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state the conditions the sample would be in for example the temp . of the room .
you would need to know the amount of vinegar needed the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water .
at the start of the procedure we would need to know what four samples we were testing . otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment . we also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers . we finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in plastic glass we need to know this as well .
additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure . also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given .
after reading this procedure i have noticed that i would need to know the ph of the vinegar . also i would need to know how much vinegar is needed . lastly it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off on the samples making the results different .
in order to replicate the experiment they should say what temperature to keep the room at they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results . and also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in because if one sample is bigger than another that will also change the results .
after reading the group s procedure i have determined they could add what four different samples you are using during the experiment . the group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers . the temperature at which the samples are to dry for min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined .
additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers the size of the containers themselves and how long i would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vinegar .
you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know a saw things . i would need to know how much vinegar they used what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used .
in order to replicate this experiment i would need a hypothesis the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid i would need . i would do the experiment the same way so i would also need to know what kind of container to use . i would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended .
in order to replicate the experiment the group s procedure should mention which samples to use . marble limestone wood and plastic . it should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container and the size of the samples needed for testing .
how much vinegar they added into each container and how long do you rise each sample for also the temperature the writer would be where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold hot areas .
in order to replicate the experiment additional information is needed . you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container in step you need to know what material you are putting in each container . you also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in step .
after reading the group s procedure i can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment . first i would need to the materials needed for the lab . i would need to get these items in ahead of time and have the right things like containers . i would also need to know what kind of rocks were used . if i was looking at a sheet or instructions that contained only the procedure i would need to know what rocks were used . a third thing the procedure hasn t told us is the amount of vinegar . for this to be a valid experiment we would need to use the same amount of vinegar .
after reading the group procedure the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples . the group does not say what they are also one over not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container . the group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample .
in order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container . i would also need to know what type of container . i would even like
some additional information i would include on the group s procedure would be to specify the types of samples from the first step . also to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be . the way the masses were measured should also be included along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain . the place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well . lastly they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar .
this experiment p in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar put on the container the size of the samples i d need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples what kind of container do i have to use .
a good procedure would show a little more information such as how much vinegar you pour into each container . it should also tell the size and or type of containers used in this experiment . also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the results .
in order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information . first they need to specify what the
in order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container . also what size container should be used . another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at . lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed .
if i was going to repeat this experiment i would need to know things about the vinegar i would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar . what type of plastic would i need what temperature would i put the samples soak in .
after reading the group s procedure additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry tint paper towel in the sun . etc
some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container the size or amount of each sample needed the type of containers to hold each sample in .
one piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers . a second piece is to know samples of what the first step says samples but can they be anything lastly i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment . i should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that .
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the samples two how big the pieces of rocks are if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers do they need a lid to cover evaporation how large are they . more specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here .
in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed . the size of the container needs to be determined . also the procedure just says four different samples it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers . finally it doesn t say how long the sample should be rinse for . if those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated .
in the students procedure you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity . also they should specify what type of container to put each sample in such as a test tube or a beaker . the students should specify what samples to use in step as well so that when replicated the same samples will be used .
to replicate this experiment you would need the following information . you would need the amount of vinegar the students used you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used . also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used .
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the ph of the vinegar and the room temperature
a the group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample . p b the size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment . p c would need to know what materials to gather .
in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know first or all what each sample is . they would also need to know how much vinegar to use on the materials . lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material . the would need and the substance size .
so additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need the size of the containers used in the experiment . you would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the hour period .
after reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the .
in order to replicate the acid rain experiment we must know more than what the group has given us . for example in step the students don t tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container . they also don t tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of . in step the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples . they don t say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples . another problem is that they don t tell us what the samples are until we see the data table they should say it in the procedure .
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used . also you would need to know what size and shape the samples are . also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn t state .
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they poured on the three samples the size of the samples and the size of the containers . we would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did .
we would need to know how much vinegar to use in each containers also what type of container should be used and if we re using pure vinegar or if its a solution . lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the hours .
i would trusted to know where is being tested another word the specie materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment .
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment . first i would need to know what type of material is being used . another thing i would need to know is where to keep the material in sunlight in darkness outside i would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup .
since the groups procedure is a little vogue in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know some additional information . first you d need to where to let the sample sit and dry because that could make a difference . and you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant . finally you d need to know what are the different samples to use . you know by looking in the data table when they don t list items in the procedure .
in order to replicate the groups procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed . with these pieces of information i could more accurately follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is . then i would need to know what the three samples are . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use . the amounts are not specified . finally it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be .
after reading the groups procedure there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the experiment . in the procedure the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass . also the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers . last but not the least the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples .
the information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers . the size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use . without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment .
i would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on . i would also need to know the problem to this experiment . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment .
in order to replicate this i would need to know what the samples this are testing for so you don t know what to test . also around how much of the samples do you need g or g or g . also how much vinegar to pour into each container . they must should be specific . they could have also added what to measure in grams kg lo etc . they should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in light dark warm cold .
first at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there . in step you need to be told how much vinegar to pour . in step it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry . then in step once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples .
you would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use . the size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment .
in order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information . one piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container . you also need to know what the conditions are made out of . the last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container .
to replicate the experiment i would have to know the size of its containers i use . also i would need to know how much vinegar they poured in . lastly what is the sample material that a major part of the experiment .
to replicate the experiment a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample . they would also need to know what containers they used . a person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment .
the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be how much vinegar to pour in the containers how big do the samples have to be what should the labels say on them how much water do i use and how long do i rinse for and how do i measure the mass
the group of students didn t specify what samples they were referring to . secondly they didn t include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers . they didn t give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step . all of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment .
in this procedure the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used . all this information is needed to replicate the experiment .
how much basis was used in each container rinse with distilled water for how long . how much the container have to be .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container i would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and i would also need to know the size of each container .
first the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container . also the group should use a control in this experiment . to replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what conditions the samples an the vinegar will be in . we would need to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference .
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into .
we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . it would also be helpful to know the size of the container size of the sample to use . the process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information .
i would first need to know what material the samples know and i would need to know how much vinegar . i would also need to know how big each sample should be . also how big the container would be .
you need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers . you also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in . also you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for min .
. what kind of samples p . how much vinegar p . what kind of container
to replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information . firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additional for every material . secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for hours after pouring vinegar . different environments could affect the date . third you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment . differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data .
additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using marble limestone wood plastic also it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup and what kind of cup to use . also how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly be more specific on how to dry the samples should you dry it with paper towel and then let it sit for minutes or just let it sit
the additional information needed would be the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup . you would also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in . lastly you may need to know that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic .
some information i would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass . also i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers . and finally where do i pour the samples when filter and after the containers
to replicate this experiment i would need to know what four different samples i am getting and how to measure the mass . what containers do i put them in how much vinegar do i put into the containers do just let the containers sit out in room temp for hours do i cover the containers how do you measure the ending mass of each sample
to replicate the experiment you would need to know what samples to test how much vinegar to put in the containers and the temperature in which the samples are kept for hours .
in order to replicate group s experiment we would need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples . we would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container .
after reading the group s procedure i realized that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples you need to know the samples are limestone wood marbles plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are . you also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used .
the first most dams piece of information missing from the procedure is the types of samples you need in the experiment . you cannot replicate the experiment without knowing what samples to use . the next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be . you should not have to guess what or appropriate size should be . also the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container . the amount of vinegar needed is essential information . also the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored . for example should they be left covered or not
the first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples . they also need to tell you to find record the starting mass of each sample . you d also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . finally they need to say at what temperature they should sit room temp .
the three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are different it s easily affected the final result .
you would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not as this would affect the amount of mass lost . you would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass . you would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use .
in order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it s the same or not you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers . the given procedure doesn t tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers .
in order to this experiment to be replicated i would need to know how many or what size samples i should be weighing how much vinegar needs to be poured what to label each container and how long i need to rinse each sample . only if i know these specific details will i then be able to complete the experiment like the other group .
additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure . also what type of containers should you put the samples in how big should they be . another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right .
the procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked . first there was no specification regarding the samples the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested . let done specify which suitably materials were used marble limestone wood and plastic . they also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at as well as the concentration of the vinegar with important measurements that can potentially affect data .
i would need to know how much vinegar they used . how big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using .
to replicate this experiment i will need to know the size of the containers in which i should pour the vinegar the amount of vinegar and the size of the materials .
in order to replicate the experiment i need to know how much vinegar i should put into the four separate containers . i would also need to know what temperature . i should place the containers while they sit for hours . i would need to know where i should place the containers too for example in light in dark place or have it exposed to sunlight .
in order to run this experiment i would need to know what samples are being tested . i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution . i would also need to know what size the container should be that i m pouring the solutions into .
what are the four different samples there is no control so how do you know what water is . how much vinegar do you need to put into the containers how big does the sample need to be .
there are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
in order to complete this experiment i would need to have
you would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample . you would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar .
the reliability isn t very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled variable like ml per container . also the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for hours at so the repel ilyin can have the same temperature . also there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water such as seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed .
you also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container what types of container to use and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment .
i would need to know the certain type of samples i would need to use to complete the experiment . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so i would have unreasonable results . i would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment whether it it is big medium or small . it would also help to show the problem so i would understand what i am trying to investigate .
in order to replicate the group s experiment i would have to know more information . for example it says to put vinegar but it doesn t say the measurement of how much would be needed . it would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in . lastly the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar .
the additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind . you would also need to know how they determined the mass . you would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup . it would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in .
the first thing i would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all . also the procedure should saw what the different samples are marble limestone wood plastic . also after placing the samples into containers i believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others .
in order to make the group s experiment more replicate the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable . secondly how much vinegar should be added to each sample thirdly in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity a control should be tested . in an experiment like this the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled h o .
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps . a few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at .
some other information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container how big should the sample be in question and how much water do you rinse it with in question also the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube .
we would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment . we would also need to know what kind of container they used . these two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original . we would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio . lastly we need to know the concentration of the vinegar .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of the sample is put in also how much vinegar to pour in . i would also need to know what i am measuring the mass in grams etc . if i had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment . they also need say where to place the samples a counter in the sun in the closet they say nothing . also the biggest of all what am i taking this for
i would need to know how much vine
it is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container . it is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used . the group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in .
in order to appropriately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances . also in this experiment you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same . also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the sc means would take to rinse the objects with distilled water . also in this experiment it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out .
you need to know the amount of vinegar you poured . the size of the containers you are using . and all samples must be put in the same areas . because the temperature and sunlight s does changes the result .
the first thing necessary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain . the second thing necessary would be how long we rinse of each sample with d water . the third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers .
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container . also i would need to know what samples i am using . i would need to know what size or shape of container to use . finally i would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container .
one additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using this is key regarding the reactions of the samples solidify and structure . another piece of information i would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup . lastly i would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar .
in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing les oz etc . also we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open . also what conditions should they be left in for the hours darkness light both this is what we must know to replicate this experiment .
in this experiment many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it first was that the names of the sample were not given so we don t know what to take the mass of . second was that it didn t tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginning of the procedure . lastly we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the hour time period . other than this the experiment was written decently .
some additional information that would be needed to replicate the acid rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers . also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature thought the experiment . lastly in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should i dry it .
i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container i would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the hours . i would also need to know how i would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample and i also need to know how many times i would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar .
they would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve . also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are . another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours are they all in the same spot as in dark or light . these are some key things that need to be included .
to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant . the containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same . the materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment .
some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step what size you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in .
additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers . and if it should be the same amount in all . more information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water . lastly information also needed is where to put the samples for the hours . it doesn t say if the samples were put in different locations .
after i read the groups procedure i determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step . another piece of information you need is what type of vinegar you need . the last piece of information you need is what size container should you use .
how long the samples how much the vinegar at how big should containers be .
in order to replicate the experiment the procedure must tell us what materials they use for samples they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water .
to replicate the experiment one would need to know how much vinegar was used . it would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used . to replicate the experiment one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in .
in order to replicate this experiment we should be told the amount of vinegar in m ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the hours of it trying in an incubator .
to replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples . you would also need to know how long to rinse the samples . you would also want to know how they dried the material if you want to get the same data .
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers . you would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completely you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completely submerged or if it was floating on top .
additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples . i would need to know the samples used to replicate this experiment . also i would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare should it be submerged or not . also i would need to know does temperature play a key factor what is the temperature . lastly i would want to know the acidity of the acid ana vinegar .
in order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information . you would need to know materials the different samples are how much vinegar was used whether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar . without this information our data could be different .
to repeat the students experiment you would need to know additional to the procedure
in order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample . also you need to know what kind of container plastic metal paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of . also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different matter make different conclusions due to surface area and such .
initially in order to do this experiment one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use . the students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistent in order for the experiment to be accurately reproduced . the students should have included the type and size of the container the apparatus used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
other information
first you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup . secondly the amount of each substance should be the same . next what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid too wide
additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers . i would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the hour waiting period . finally i would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it .
the procedure is missing some critical info . first of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab . i would not know what i needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure . also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers . finally the group did not say the size of the container .
one piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used . you would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup . you might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same . on other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of h . o applied .
there are several things this group should have included in their procedure . they did not specify what type of container or how large . they did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container . they did not say what to do with the container when you finish . they did not specify how they determined the mass .
in order to replicate this experiment thoroughly one would need to know the approximate size of each sample as a inch block of wood and a cm block would react differently . also are would need to know how how much vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for hours .
i would need to know what were the four different samples . how much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains . also what to label the containers and should i leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole hours .
to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . it would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be . lastly they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking . if they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else .
for this experiment i would want to know how much vinegar i should pour into the cup . pouring different amounts could change the mass . the other information i would need is if i needed to rinse the material in a timely manner sec sec etc . this could also effect the mass of the material . i would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size . that also could effect the difference of the mass s .
if someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used . if being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials . also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there . they should also specify that types of containers are used . maybe restrain types affect the experiment and some don t and they should then made note of that
in order to replace the experiment yale would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material . moreover yale would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept . lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each individual sample .
the group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be . another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container . the group also forgot to mention what samples they are using . without these main information points nobody could replicate this lab .
additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers . also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for . finally the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry . you need to know whether it should be in a cold wet environment or maybe warm dry .
in order to replicate the experiment procedure should include the names of the four different samples the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup and the size of the four identical containers .
after reading the procedure some things are still unclear . they should say what samples are being tested not just mass samples . also how much vinegar should we pour and in what sort of container what should we label the containers as how should the samples be removed from the container and as always what are the materials we need and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that i should pour into the four cups . i would also need to know where to store the cups . it would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well . much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment .
in able to replicate this procedure steps must be added p what are the samples . p how much vinegar is poured into the containers . p what unit of measurement is used to measure it mass . p what kind of containers were used .
additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include p what kind of four samples are being used . p how much vinegar to pour into the containers . p what kind of containers are being used . p how to to remove the samples and place them into containers . p what to label each of the separate containers .
to replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing . how much vinegar they used how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used . if they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment .
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mrs of vinegar to use . you would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with . to replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in . the type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results .
the additional information needed would be pheasant of vinegar that goes into each container . you will also need to know where are supposed to leave the samples . they should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples .
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample . without these you cannot replicate the experiment .
in order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to . one last thing that would need to be specified is the conversation of the vinegar . if when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occur .
the students should have included information about what the samples were what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use .
the group will need to put to the following information . what are the four different samples . what type of containers will be needed . also what size . they will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar . the temperature should be consistent
to replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you re using . you would also have to know where you re leaving these containers . and lastly to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you re putting these in that and or the size of the original sample .
to repeat this lab i would need to know what kind of vinegar they used . how much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not .
one thing you would need to know is what use of containers you need . in step they do not say the size of the container they just said you need them . also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure . as in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers .
to replicate the acid aim experiment the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear . there should be a set and constant amount of vinegar and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included . it should also say how to find the mass whether to use water and a graduated cylinder or a triple beam balance .
in order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add things . what type of woods plastic limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use . how much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not . also what sir container . another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don t absorb more or less water . and finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers and i d also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical containers were i would also need to know how much water distilled was used to rinse off the samples and for how long did the students rinse the samples i may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment .
after reading this groups experiment i have found that to do this experiment over again i would need additional information additional information would need would include what kind of container do i put the materials in what size container was used to put the materials in what surface or what do i are the materials with and how much vinegar would i put in the if separate containers i would need all this information to perform of this experiment .
what the samples are how much vinegar should be added to each container where the samples are contained for the hr waiting period .
to repeat the experiment i would have to know much vinegar i am pouring into containers . i need to know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet .
the procedure given doesn t have enough information so that someone could replicate it . what else is needed is to state the different samples needed . it also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples . lastly we need to know what kind of containers how big each of them are .
you would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it . you would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment would be replicated .
i would include what the samples are wood marble etc and would label the containers that way . i would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used . i would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at .
first you would need to know what materials to use as samples . second you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . lastly you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at .
some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container . if not specified someone may put too little or too much and the results can come out very differently . you would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry .
if i wanted to replicate the experiment i would need to know what kind of containers to use i would need to know if i should cover the samples in the containers i would also need to know what the samples are . how am i suppose to know what i am tasting if i don t know what the samples are .
additional information that would be needed . we need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample what temperature to keep sample at and how long to rinse the samples for .
the group neglected to include what the four different samples are . they should have said use a scale to determine the individual mass g of four different samples of material marble limestone wood and plastic . they also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers . they should have included how much ml vinegar should be poured into each container what containers are made of . they also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to . they also never listed the materials that needed to be used .
one thing missing from this experiment is the precise measurement of vinegar pour experiment . you would also need to have the samples all the same size . thirdly you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment .
to repeat the experiment you said first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers . you would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses . you said also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for hours . also what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers where would they sit
to replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use you would also need to know what the four different samples were . lastly you would need to know how long to note samples for .
after reading this groups procedure there are four different pieces of information i would need to replicate this exact experiment . one the group must include what the samples are anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing . two you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container . thirdly they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the hours . lastly i would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers
in order to figure out how to replicate this i would need to know the containers size . also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in . i would need to know how long to wash with water for .
after reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample there was . also you would need to know what kind of vinegar they re using as well as how much to pour into the container . you might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water .
the groups procedure could use they could add to find the difference in mass at the end . also list the type of several they roused . and they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they roused .
you will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at . p the surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar . p how much vinegar to put the samples in .
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar .
the additional information that i would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers what are the four samples to put something over the containers and what are steps of the samples .
specify what the samples are in step . specify how much vinegar in step . specify the size of the container in step . in step specify how one should remove the samples from the containers .
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first naming the four different samples given to you . secondly you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers . thirdly you would need to know how you would determine the mass example with an electric balance . the students need to be more specific on their materials .
first things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers . another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar . lastly i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them .
you would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers . you would also have to know what environment to put the cups in in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area . p lastly you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside or on a table etc .
. how much vinegar how big a container were the samples completely covered p . what temperature did the samples sit at p . rinse samples how long or until what desired effect
some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used . you would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass .
i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup . i would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in particular . do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items how long do i rinse the sample in distilled water for
to replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get . i could get any thing i saw and it would fit the description in the procedure . you also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them . you should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system .
you also would need to know how much vinegar to use what kind of vinegar to use and the different samples .
after reading the group s procedure there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment . first off you would need to know what the samples are and what size of samples you will testing . another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you d pour in the containers step two . from steps one and six you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in . ie grams pounds couples
to replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples in other words samples of what one would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in . should the samples be placed in a beaker graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container one would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after hours .
if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of each sample was used . i would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container . also the size of the container would be helpful . i might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material .
additional information i would need to know would include several things . i would need to know what the four samples of material are . i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container . i would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be .
the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble limestone wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified .
to replicate this procedure i ll need to know the size of the containers . i ll need to know the samples and i ll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container . the amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample .
the additional information i need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar i pour in each of the containers how big or small the containers have to be and whether or not i should close the containers .
you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each separate container also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for hours .
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container the type of container what they mean by a four different samples if not given data table as well as the form of the rock liquids crushed whole etc .
in order to replicate the acid rain experiment it is essential to know what the samples are . in the step it says to determine the mass of four samples . what are the samples also how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample in step it says pour vinegar in each four separate but identical containers . what is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used also in the th step it says to rinse each sample with distilled water . for long should the sample be rinsed
the additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar .
